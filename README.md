# jeremy-gaming-hub

This is a startup landing page in HTML and CSS from ideas learned in the Udemy course: The Complete Web Developer 2020 by Andrei Neagoie.

I have utilized the template, Now UI Kit by Creative Tim and put a little spin of my own creating a gaming hub-esque website. 

Please take a look, thanks!
